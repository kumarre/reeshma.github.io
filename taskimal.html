      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>As a Junior in college, I’m incredibly busy every day managing classes, events, and errands. Oftentimes, it becomes too much to handle and I end up skipping one event or the other, putting off errands I have to complete or not prioritizing what I need to get done. I have a significant problem which I’ve previously attributed to laziness but it could be looked at as a lack of incentivization. How would I be able to incentivize my tasks and calendar events to feel more inclined to accomplish them? I decided to build an app to accomplish this that would not only organize all my tasks and events for the day (which normal calendars already do) but would also gamify my tasks and allow me to assign and earn points for completing my tasks and take care of a virtual pet- essentially creating more incentive to complete my tasks.</p>

      <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
      <p>Students want to stay motivated to finish their tasks so that they can accomplish more, feel more responsible, and experience less stress</p>

      <h4>Research/Ideation</h4>
      <p>I first tried to think of examples of simple games that were compelling to play and that would easily be able to reward/penalize you for completing/not completing a task. I thought of a Tamagotchi and how invested I was in keeping my pet alive. If the livelihood of an adorable virtual pet was on the line in accomplishing daily tasks, then there would be an incentive to accomplish these tasks. I also took inspiration from the app Habitica, which is an app that attempts to solve the same problem. However, I didn’t like the extent to which it was gamified. I know I would be too busy to invest that much time in the game aspect of the app and I wanted something cleaner, less long term, formatted so that adults with limited technology understanding or hectic lives would easily be able to use it, and looks similar to the productivity apps (e.i. Google Calendar, Any.do) that people are accustomed to using.</p>

        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/anydo.png" alt="Any.do"/> <p>Any.do</p></div>
      </div>

      <p>I also pulled from my knowledge about gameful learning and motivational theory. In motivational theory, there is an understanding that everyone is motivated, just maybe not motivated to do what is requested of them: such is the case when I don't feel motivated to accomplish my more difficult or time-intensive tasks. To channel this motivation, I took a couple principles that support gameful learning- clear goals, identity play, autonomy, and productive failure- and applied them to help me gamify the app.</p>
      <p>1) Goals: In outlining clear goals, the user/player knows what they need to accomplish and can easily see what they are working towards. After they accomplish a goal, if the user is rewarded by gaining merit or traction in the game, they are more inclined to interact more with the game as well.</p>
      <p>2) Identity Play: With identity play, the user/player identifies with their avatar on the screen and feels a sense of accomplishment or failure corresponding with how well their avatar performs. The user is more inclined to perform well in the game so they can feel a greater sense of accomplishment.</p>
      <p>3) Autonomy: Giving the user/player a version of the game that is curated by them makes them more invested in what comes next.</p>
      <p>4) Productive Failure: Games typically support failure by not punishing the user/player too much if they don't succeed at something. Lack of support after failure can make the user risk-averse or not want to continue with the game/app since they don't want to fail.</p>
      
      <h4>Design Process</h4>
      <h5>General Design Ideas</h5>
      <p>I wanted my app to be very clean and minimalistic so that it looked easy to use and reinforced the idea that it helps organize the users life. To do this, I picked calm color of dark blue and tried to minimze the amount of words, colors, and buttons on the screen. I was used to seeing apps' main buttons on the bottom of the screen but since there are only two in my app they were very awkward to place. I decided to place them at the top, similar to Apple's Facetime app. After getting input from other designers, I added a "tasks completed" ratio to the top as well so the user could always see it no matter what type of calendar view they were on and would quickly be able to see how many more tasks they have to complete. The settings button is at the top as well, similar to many other apps (e.i. Spotify) so that it's purpose is intuitive for the user to understand.</p>

      <h5>App Major Features</h5>
      <p>I narrowed down my app to include 3 major features:</p>
      <p>1) Add/edit tasks</p>
      <p>2) Virtual pet and health bar</p>
      <p>3) Google Calendar integration</p>
      <p>The ability to add/edit tasks would be the most essential component of the app. The virtual pet and health bar would would help gamify the app- similar to a Tamagotchi. Google Calendar integration would help the app look similar to the productivity apps that the user may already use and would allow users to still use the google calendar service that they're comfortable with. My prototype for this app expanded on these main functions. I’ll break down each of the initial design ideas and highlight the decisions I made as I go through each screen.</p>

      <h6>1) Add/Edit Tasks</h6>
      <p>Other calendar and task apps have the ability to add/edit tasks. I liked the design of the Google Calendar add button and decided to model my add and edit event page after the Google Calendar's. I also thought that many people are familiar with the Google Calendar layout and so if the design of my app paralled that it would be more intuitive to use.</p>
      
      <div id="img-group">
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/google-add-event.png" alt="Google Cal Main Page"/> <p>Google Calendar Main Screen</p></div>
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/taskimal.png" alt="Taskimal Main Page"/> <p>Taskimal Main Screen</p></div>
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/google-event.png" alt="Google Add Event"/> <p>Google Add Event Screen</p></div>
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/event.gif" alt="Taskimal Add Event"/> <p>Taskimal Add Event Screen</p></div>
      </div>

      <p>To create more incentive to accomplish tasks I added the ability for the user to customize the amount of points they would like to make their tasks. This offers the user more <b>autonomy</b> which makes them feel more accountable when they don't accomplish the goals they created.</p>

      <div id="img-group">
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/points.png" alt="Taskimal Points Page"/> <p>Taskimal Points Screen</p></div>
      </div>

      <h6>2) Virtual Pet and Health Bar</h6>
      <p>The virtual pet was created for the purpose of identity play. The pet emotes how well the user is doing in accomplishing their tasks, offering encouragement to the user to continue performing well.</p>

      <div id="img-group">
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/emotions.png" alt="Taskimal Emotions"/> <p>Taskimal Pet Emotions</p></div>
      </div>

      <p>By having the ability to choose the type of virtual pet and create the pet's name the app provides more autonomy for the user so they feel more responsible for what happens.</p>
      
      <div id="img-group">
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/choose.png" alt="Taskimal Choose Avatar"/> <p>Taskimal Choose Avatar/Name Screen</p></div>
      </div>

      <p>The pet also rewards the user for accomplishing their tasks by awarding them food whenever they complete 50% of their tasks points for the day(fish) or their task with the most amount of points(milk). The process of earning, feeding, and the pet reacting to the food rewards the user for accomplishing their goals and offers them positive reinforcement to continue doing well.</p>

      <div id="img-group">
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/fish.png" alt="Taskimal Feeding Fish"/> <p>Taskimal Feeding Fish Animation</p></div>
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/milk.png" alt="Taskimal Feeding Milk"/> <p>Taskimal Feeding Milk Animation</p></div>
      </div>

      <p>The health bar for the pet was built to show the user how many points they had earned for the day out of their total as well describing the health of their pet. I initially wanted to include a happiness bar to differentiate between how many tasks the user completed per week (health) to how many they had completed that day (happiness). However, if the user was not able to complete tasks during a certain point in the week, it would be very discouraging for the user to have to continue throughout the week knowing that they won't be able to fill up their happiness bar. I decided that this would not allow for <b>productive failure</b> so I got rid of the happiness bar and only kept the health bar to track the user on a daily basis.</p>

      <div id="img-group">
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/happiness.png" alt="Taskimal Happiness Bar"/> <p>Original Taskimal Pet Layout</p></div>
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/health.png" alt="Taskimal Health Bar"/> <p>Current Taskimal Pet Layout</p></div>
      </div>

      <p>The health bar is also one of the main rewarding features in place for the user to be positively encouraged to continue pursuing their <b>goals</b>. After later input from other designers, I added the "tasks completed" ratio to easily show the user how many tasks(not points) they've completed out of their total. Other interactions with the app- crossing off an item on the To-Do list and selecting 'Yes' when asked if the user attended an event- also encourage the user as well.</p>

      <h6>3) Google Calendar Integration</h6>
      <p>In order for those with hectic lives and for general usability, I wanted this app to be integrated with existing calendar apps and for the design to be as intuitive as possible. With google calendar integration, the user can easily use the calendars they already have with the app. I've also created an alternate default view that looks very similar to the Google Calendar's main screen so that the user can choose which view they would prefer.</p>

      <div id="img-group">
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/settings.png" alt="Taskimal Settings"/> <p>Taskimal Settings</p></div>
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/calendar.png" alt="Taskimal Calendar Screen"/> <p>Taskimal Calendar Screen</p></div>
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/taskimal/google-add-event.png" alt="Google Calendar Main Screen"/> <p>Google Calendar Main Screen</p></div>
      </div>  

      <h4>Future Updates</h4>
      <p>Future update ideas for this app include:</p>
      <ul>
        <p>- A history section where the user can see how they’ve performed over the past week or month</p>
        <p>- More pet animation (e.i. bobbing back and forth and blinking on the home page, giggling or making a different noise if the user pokes them or purring if they “pet” them, making a sound or performing an action when the user gains a certain amount of points)</p>
        <p>- More customizable pets, such as more animal options or clothing options (things that wouldn’t add more confusion to the user’s involvement with the app but would add more personality to the pet and would increase attachment to it)</p>
        <p>- A motivational message at the beginning of the day to get the user thinking about the app and their tasks right from the get-go</p>
        <p>- Raise a pet with other people- encourage your friends to accomplish their tasks as well</p>
