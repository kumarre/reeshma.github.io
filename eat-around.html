      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>On a trip I recently went on with a friend to Chicago, we decided that we wanted to go on our own food tour of the city. That is, we wanted to taste food and snacks that were a "must try", special to Chicago, interesting, or that the locals thought was something we had to check out before we left. We spent hours before our trip looking up the best places and dishes to try that were near where we were staying and within our price range but it was difficult to find all that information and we ended up feeling like we were missing out on some good or interesting foods. In my first venture into Figma, I decided to design an app that would take crowdsourced recommendations of food items, be it whole dishes or just snacks and drinks, and allow these items to be searched by a user. I also wanted the app to create a tour of the city using the items selected so the user would easily be able to see how the foods they want to try fit into a path they can take around the city.</p>

      <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
      <p>Tourists want an app that compiles the most popular food items in a city so they can go on a food sampling tour and enjoy good/unique food recommended by locals and tourists</p>

      <h4>Research/Ideation</h4>
      <p>I wanted this app to act similarly as Yelp. However on Yelp, recommendations and reviews do not go towards specific dishes, the focus is on the restaurants. I wanted this app to run like Google Maps' search engine, but instead, the user would be able to type in a search and be given the highest recommended food. I wanted the user to be able to search by restaurant (to find what's good to eat there), by city (to see good food nearby), by food (to see which restaurant made that food the best), and by recommeder (to see what other foods they recommend, what tours they've gone on). I also wanted the tour the user creates to be shown on a map with a starting and ending destination similar to Google Maps.</p>

      </div>
   
      <h4>Design Process</h4>
      <h5>General Design Ideas</h5>
      <p>I decided to settle on a design theme that exudes coffeehouse vibes- since that brings to mind a warm, cozy, artsy setting, as well as a niche place that locals frequently habit. I also wanted my app to look fun and adventurous so it would spark curiosity in the user to find cool and interesting food choices. I settled on a dull orange to brown tone for the app so it would give off this vibe. I also picked a more quirky font to play with this theme of curiosity as well.</p>

      </div>

      <h5>App Major Features</h5>
      <p>I narrowed down my app to include 3 major features:</p>
      <p>1) Search</p>
      <p>2) Recommend</p>
      <p>3) Create a Tour</p>
      <p>The search feature would be the main part of the app, allowing for users to find the foods they want. The recommend feature would be the supporting function for the search feature since the recommendations are what create the most popular search results. The "create a tour" feature would look similar to the directions feature of Google Map's and would provide an organized itinerary for users to explore the search results they found and wanted to check out.</p>

      <h6>1) Search</h6>
      <p>I wanted the search screen layout to be similar to the layout of Google Maps. This way the user would be able to easily see where the items are located (which is important if the user is visiting a city) as well as what they are. The layout of the item description I also modelled after the Google Maps results. What's different is the "add" and reccommend button underneath the distance. This allows the user to quickly add the item to their current tour they're creating and the recommend button allows them to create a recommendation for that item as well.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Future Changes</p>
      <p>After thinking more about the usability of the app, I realized that users would often not want to search for food in a particular city but rather a tour or a foods that a member has recommended- something more nuanced. I created a wireframe for how I thought the new search screen would be layed out which accounts for all the food, tour, and recommenders that would show up related to the search. For example, the user searched up a restaurant, the results would should foods that have been recommended from that restaurant, tours that include that restaurant, and recommenders that mention that restaurant. I changed the search bar to be similar to Groupon's search bar as well. This way, it's easier for the user to choose what they are searching for in the city they want - with near me being the default.</p>

      <div id="img-group">
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/eat-around/groupon.png" alt="Groupon Main Screen"/> <p>Groupon Main Screen</p></div>
        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/eat-around/search-update.png" alt="Eat Around Search Wireframe"/> <p>Eat Around Search Wireframe Update</p></div>
      </div>

      <p>I also wanted to update the search so that you could search within either the food, tour, and recommender category from the main screen. The user would also be able to filter and sort the results. For example, the user can filter the food search by cuisine or meal type and select to search for only gluten-free foods. And the user can sort by low to high price or low to high calorie if they want as well.</p>

      </div>

      <h5>Recommend</h5>
      <p>The layout for the recommendation is simple so it's easy and quick for someone to create one. I made the City, Restaurant, Menu Item, and Food Category mandatory so the food items have sufficient information to display to the user.</p>

        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/eat-around/recommend.png" alt="Eat Around Recommendation Screen"/> <p>Eat Around Recommendation Screen</p></div>
      </div>

      <h6>Future Changes</h6>
      <p>I really wanted to make the Recommendation screen more nuanced so that the user would be able to narrow down their searches and be able to find specific products. For example, I wanted to include the different tags and categories (meal, cuisine, dietary, and misc.) so that users could filter their searches and the items with these tags would appear in their search results. I tried to keep the most important items and required items at the top of the screen so the user wouldn't get discouraged from filling out a recommendation. I also wanted to include a recommendation for tours. So when a user clicks on a tour they are able to comment on how much they enjoyed it or disliked it. I also wanted buttons next to the reviews on the page for people to flag the comment if it is offensive or like the review if it is useful.</p>

        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/eat-around/search-update.png" alt="Eat Around Search Wireframe"/> <p>Eat Around Search Wireframe Update</p></div>
      </div>

      <h5>Create A Tour</h5>
      <p>The tour screen is part of the user's account on the app. The user is able to add food items they search for to the tour that they are currently creating. The tour feature would create a tour for the user that would take them the shortest distance from the item closest to them to the item that is the farthest away. The tour screen includes a map of the locations of the items the path you would take to get to each one - similar to looking up directions on Google Maps. The stops on the tour can be clicked on to reveal more details about the item.</p>

      </div>

      <h6>Future Changes</h6>
      <p>Instead of naming the tour for the city it is in, I wanted to take into account if people were creating tours in the same city or wanted to name their tour something more specific. So I wanted to provide them the opportunity to create the name of their tour and include the location of the tour as well. This layout should still be similar to the Google Maps layout since that layout is what users are most used to using.</p>

        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/eat-around/tour-update.png" alt="Eat Around Tour Screen Update"/> <p>Eat Around Tour Screen Update</p></div>
      </div>

      <h5>Future General Updates</h5>
      <p>- I want to create a more readable font and fewer bold colors. I think the font is artsy enough for the first screen the user vists but from then on it's too messy. Also, the colors are a bit too saturated so the screen seems poluted with color</p>

      <p>- Change the My Account screen to include: the ability to favorite food items, toors, and recommenders to revisit them later from the user's account and a "Food Passport" for users to add their favorite foods and keep track or where they ate them, when they ate them, what it looks like, and can write a description as well</p>

        <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/eat-around/passport.png" alt="Eat Around Food Passport Screen"/> <p>Eat Around Food Passport Screen</p></div>
      </div>

      <p>- Have a section in the user's account with a collection of all the foods they've had, including when they had it and an optional note they can add about it (similar to a stamp book)</p>

      <p>- Add tags to the food items and tours that including wierd, tasty, unique, fun etc.</p>

      <p>Have an option for the tour to be private or public (searchable) and the ability to add a description to a tour so the user and other users can understand more about it</p>
