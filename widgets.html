      <h4>Outline</h4>
      <p>During my time at Stats Perform I was introduced to several in-progress UX projects. I was particularly intrigued by the company's Widgets product since it was aimed at appealing to "sports fans" and was public-facing. The project scope allowed me to go through the entire UX design process: from initial market assessment and user research to design iterations and prototypes. I decided to focus on Tennis Widgets since I'm a big fan of the sport and it was a category that the company had yet to update on the Widgets product line.</p>
      <p>The following description of my work during this project will be organized according to the deliverable plan I followed during the internship.</p>
      
      <h4>Background Research</h4>
        <h5>Market Assessment</h5>
        <p>During this stage of the project, I researched what competitors and the media landscape had to offer for men's and women's professional tennis. I focused on finding holes in the coverage that was offered and potential opportunities that Stats Perform an capitalize on to make an impact on the market. The information I researched looked into how many tournaments there are in a season, tournament information, athlete information, the nature of tennis analytics, the types of resources that are available for tennis fans etc. It was important to understand the breadth of the information available in the market, the point at which competitors/analogous products seek to intervene, and understanding Stats Perform's potential within the two.</p>

        <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
        <p>In order to better understand how the proposed Tennis Widgets would look and what information they would contain, I conducted a competitive analysis. I analyzed tennis information websites such as ESPN, Yahoo Sports, CBSSports, and NBC Sports as well as the Tennis Widgets offered by competing sport data company, Sportradar. I also paid attention to widgets in other sports - particularly NASCAR, Golf, and MMA - from other websites. Similarly to Tennis, these are individual sports and their designs tended to be more fleshed out than the websites' Tennis Widget designs.

        <div id="img-group">
          <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/competitive-analysis.png" alt="Competitive Analysis"/> <p>Part of the Competitive Analysis</p></div>
        </div>
        
        <p>I created a spreadsheet of all the different "sets" of tennis information that each site had and the corresponding type of information they included. I compared this information to the data Stats Perform had in their database to get a feel for what features are feasible, what user expectations need to be met, and to keep for the future to compare against insight I gain from user interviews</p>

        <h5>SWOT Analysis</h5>
        <p>After the background research was completed I created a SWOT Analysis of Stats Perform's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and potential threats when it came to researching and developing Tennis Widgets.</p>


        <div id="img-group">
          <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/opportunities.png" alt="Opportunities"/> <p>Opportunities for Stats Perform Tennis Widgets (Strengths, Weaknesses, Threats are confidential)</p></div>
        </div>

      <h4>Research Methods</h4>

        <h5>User Interviews</h5>
        <p>After the initial analysis, I conducted user interviews with tennis fans to gain greater insight into what their tennis data consumption consisted of and what their expectations and behaviors were. There were two round of interviews conducted with questions adjusted after both rounds. Otter.ai was used for notekeeping and key notes were highlighted.</p>

          <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/interview.png" alt="Interview Plan/Script"/> <p>Interview Plan/Script</p></div>
        </div>

        <h5>Affinity Diagramming</h5>
        <p>An affinity diagram was used to organize important points from interviews. The key points were tagged with which interviewee said them (to provide more context) and were grouped by similarity. I then labelled each grouping according to their unifying features and re-organized according to what "sets" of tennis information the notes fell under.</p>
        <p>These sets were then compared to the categories in the spreadsheet created during the competitive analysis. Features were added/removed to/from the spreadsheet and each feature was rated as high or low priority to be included in the design. This spreadsheet would serve as a guide for what widgets I would work towards designing and what features they should include.</p>

        </div>

        <h5>User Experience Mapping</h5>
        <p>Using the organized information from the affinity map, I designed a user experience map to better empathize with the user. I mapped out 5 major stages that the user would pass through and within each stage outlined the actions, thoughts, feelings, websites, and contexts they would experience. I also outlined several touchpoints throughout these stages where the Tennis Widgets product could incorporate or facilitate these experiences.</p>

        </div>

        <h5>Persona</h5>
        <p>Generating a persona was the last step of the research phase of my internship. I first drafted a rough draft of a primary persona which I derived from analyzing the most popular opinions and characteristics of the "average tennis fan" from the affinity diagram. I then created a more polished version of this persona after making the points more focused.

          <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/primary-persona.png" alt="Primpary Persona Final"/> <p>Final Primary Persona</p></div>
        </div>

      <h4>Present Background Research, Research Methods, and Findings</h4>
      <p>I presented my background research and findings to the project owner of the Widgets team and the rest of the engineering team. The presentation consisted of sharing the scope of Tennis Widgets, where Stats Perform could capitalize within the market, sharing the persona, and describing the "average tennis fan". I then proposed what types of widgets I was planning on designing based on my research.</p>


      <h4>Design Iteration</h4>
        <h5>Paper Prototyping</h5>
          <p>I was provided examples of widgets that the company was already developing for other sports and so I used these as inspiration for the general layout of information. After running through what the layout of the widget would be, I worked towards creating digital wireframes on Sketch.</p>

          <div id="img-group">
            <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/paper-card.jpg" alt="Paper Prototype Tournament Card"/> <p>Paper Prototype Tournamant Card</p></div>
            <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/paper-rankings.jpg" alt="Paper Prototype Rankings"/> <p>Paper Prototype Rankings</p></div>
            <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/paper-schedule.png" alt="Paper Prototype Tournament Schedule"/> <p>Paper Prototype Tournament Schedule</p></div>
        </div>

        <h5>Digital Prototyping</h5>
        <p>Paper prototypes were then transferred to Sketch.</p>

          <h6>Lo-Fi Prototyping</h6>
          <p>Within the low fidelity prototypes there were several widget layout possiblities explored. Technicalities such as spacing, evaluating the importance of information, visually emphasizing important information, and standardized navigation were the main focus of these iterations. I referenced several sources of sports information both from within and outside of the company to guide design- such as Yahoo and Google sports- since users are familiar with these products and would expect information to be organized in a similar way.</p>

          <div id="img-group">
            <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/google-scores.png" alt="Google Score Card Widget"/> <p>Google Score Card Widget</p></div>
            <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/lofi-scores.png" alt="Lo-Fi Score Card Widget"/> <p>Score Card Widget</p></div>
          </div>

          <h6>Hi-Fi Prototypes</h6>
          <p>The color, iconography, and spacing was focused on during high fidelity prototyping. Each widget was also designed to accomodate up to 8 different breakpoint sizes. Therefore, the importance of each piece of information was taken into account and utilized in the smallest designs.</p>

          <div id="img-group">
            <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/hifi-rankings-1024.png" alt="Hi-Fi Rankings 1024px width"/> <p>1024px</p></div>
            <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/hifi-rankings-540.png" alt="Hi-Fi Rankings 540px width"/> <p>540px</p></div>
            <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/hifi-rankings-300.png" alt="Hi-Fi Rankings 300px width"/> <p>300px</p></div>
          </div>

        <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
        <p>The Hi-Fi prototypes were then used in a usability test where self-described tennis fans analyzed the designs and provided valuable feedback as to what their expectations were of the designs, what ease/trouble they had in conducting tasks, and what widget design recommendations they had.</p>

          <div id="pic"> <img src="images/portfolio/widgets/usability-script.png" alt="Part of Usability Script"/> <p>Part of Usability Script</p></div>
        </div>

        <h5>Final Designs</h5>
        <p>There were several changes made to the prototypes after the usability tests in order to better cater to the users. These designs were than uploaded to InVision and interactions were added.</p>

        </div>

      <h4>Present Project to Executives</h4>
      <p>At the end of the internship, I presented my research and designs to the members of the executive team at the company as well as many other employees and the entire design team.</p>
